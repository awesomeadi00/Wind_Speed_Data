# Wind-Speed-Data-Representation
This program generates random numbers which displays different sets of windspeeds and burst speeds through a table of values. 
This table can be inputted on a graph for visualization. 

For the SimulationConfiguration.txt, the values in the txt file are represented as: 
Avg Wind Speed, Gust Value, Simulation duration, Step size
Storm Probability(Pstorm), min and max storm amplitude, max and min storm duration
Microburst probability (Pburst), min and max microburst ampltide, max and min microburst duration.
